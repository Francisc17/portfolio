I have a strong passion for continuous learning, with a primary focus on Data Science and Machine Learning. However, I also find great joy in exploring diverse subjects across various domains to expand my knowledge base. My commitment to learning extends to meticulous note-taking, where I document concepts in practice and theory from a wide range of sources, including papers, web articles, books, online courses, and other valuable learning resources. <br>
